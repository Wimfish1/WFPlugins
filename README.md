# WFPlugins
**AUTHOR: Wimfish1**

## How to Install

1. Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/Wimfish1/WFPlugins/releases/latest) tab.
   
2. Download the latest .jar file. Updates are infrequent, usually incorporating enough license keys for an extra 10 plugins each time. If an update occurs, it will be automatic.

3. Place the .jar file into your server's plugins folder and restart. This will create a folder named WFPluginsLoader.

4. Add your license keys to the configuration file inside the WFPluginsLoader folder. Use this format: `PluginName=LicenseKey`.

## License Keys

- Access public license keys on [this page](https://github.com/Wimfish1/WFPlugins/wiki).

- To request access to private license keys, either purchase the plugins [here](https://github.com/Wimfish1/WFPlugins/wiki/Buy) or DM Wimfish1 on Discord with reasons why you should be granted access.
