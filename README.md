## How to install.

- Navigate to <a href="https://github.com/Wimfish1/WFPlugins/releases/latest">Releases</a> tab.

- Download the latest .jar file. (Updated not very often as I normally add enough license keys to span for an extra 10 plugins each update)

- Add the .jar file to your plugins folder in your server and restart. This will generate a folder called WFPluginsLoader

- Add your license keys into the configuration file generated inside that folder. Eg ```PluginName=LicenseKey```. 

## License Keys

- Public license keys can be found in
